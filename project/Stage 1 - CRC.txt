A Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) model (Beck & Cunningham 1989; Wilkinson 1995; Ambler 1995) 
is a collection of standard index cards that have been divided into three sections ...

A class represents a collection of similar objects, 
a responsibility is something that a class knows or does, 
and a collaborator is another class that a class interacts with to fulfill its responsibilities.

 So how do you create CRC models? Iteratively perform the following steps:

    Find classes. Finding classes is fundamentally an analysis task because it deals with 
	identifying the building blocks for your application. 
	A good rule of thumb is that you should look for the three-to-five main classes right away, 
	such as Student, Seminar, and Professor.
	
    Find responsibilities. You should ask yourself what a class does as well as 
	what information you wish to maintain about it. 
	You will often identify a responsibility for a class to fulfill a collaboration with another class.

    Define collaborators. A class often does not have sufficient information 
	to fulfill its responsibilities. Therefore, it must collaborate (work) with other classes 
	to get the job done. Collaboration will be in one of two forms: 
	a request for information or a request to perform a task. 
	To identify the collaborators of a class for each responsibility ask yourself 
	"does the class have the ability to fulfill this responsibility?". 
	If not then look for a class that either has the ability to fulfill the missing functionality 
	or the class which should fulfill it. In doing so you'll often discover the need 
	for new responsibilities in other classes and maybe even the need for a new class or two.

    Move the cards around. To improve everyone's understanding of the system, 
	the cards should be placed on the table in an intelligent manner. 
	Two cards that collaborate with one another should be placed close together on the table, 
	whereas two cards that don't collaborate should be placed far apart. 
	Furthermore, the more two cards collaborate, the closer they should be on the desk. 
	By having cards that collaborate with one another close together, 
	it's easier to understand the relationships between classes.
